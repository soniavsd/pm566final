# Final Project

This repository was built to create the pm566 final project website. In this webiste, I explore the association between differnt modes of transportation people in the United States take to go to work (bike riding, walking, public transportation, car, and carpool), with health statuses at the County level. To assess health status, the following age adjusted rates were used: Deaths due to Diabetes, Deaths due to Alzheimer's Disease, and Deaths due to Coronary Heart Disease. Both the health status dataset and the mode of transportation to work dataset were gathered from the California Health and Human Services Open Portal. 
To access these datasets, click on the following links, or refer to them in this repository
